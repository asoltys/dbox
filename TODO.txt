Now (SQLite):
* Migration from old DB format
* Indexes
* Prepared statements

Soon:
* Parallelize uploads and downloads with threads
* Stream file to disk instead of downloading into memory
* Saving SQLite db changes dir timestamp -- try to preserve it?

Later:
* Look down directory tree until you hit a .dbox.sqlite3 file
* Add a "sync" command that pushes and pulls in one go
* Add support for partial push/pull
