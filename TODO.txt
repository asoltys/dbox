* More helpers in specs (and interpolated paths instead of File.join all over the place)
* Have pull, push, etc return a list of changed files
* Look down directory tree until you hit a .dropbox.db file
* Solve upload -> re-download issue
* Put pull, push, etc in begin blocks and rescue => save to avoid half-baked repos
* Detect old db format and migrate
* Add "move" command (that renames remote)
* Add a "sync" command that pushes and pulls in one go
* Add support for partial push/pull? (also, make it defoult behaviour from subdir?)
