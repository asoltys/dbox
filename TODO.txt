Soon:
* Refactor threading in change detection in pull to use ParallelTasks?
* Stream file to disk instead of downloading into memory
* Saving SQLite db changes dir timestamp -- try to preserve it?

Later:
* Add a "sync" command that pushes and pulls in one go
* See if prepared statements speed up operations on large repos much
* Look down directory tree until you hit a .dbox.sqlite3 file so you can use commands from anywhere inside a tree (like git)
* Add support for partial push/pull (subtree push/pull)?
